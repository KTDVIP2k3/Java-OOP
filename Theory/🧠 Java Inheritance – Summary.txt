ðŸ§  Java Inheritance â€“ Summary
1. Definition:

Inheritance is a core concept in OOP that allows a child class (subclass) to inherit fields and methods from a parent class (superclass).

It helps in reusing code and building new classes based on existing ones.

2. Usage:

Use the extends keyword to inherit from another class.

java
Copy
Edit
class Animal {
    void eat() { System.out.println("Eating..."); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Barking..."); }
}
3. Benefits:

âœ… Code Reusability â€“ reuse existing logic.

âœ… Method Overriding â€“ enables runtime polymorphism.

âœ… Abstraction â€“ hide unnecessary details, focus on functionality.

âœ… Organized structure â€“ improves readability and maintainability.
