Generic (<T>) is indeed a fundamental and crucial feature for improving code architecture. It not only helps with code reuse but also directly influences other important design principles.

The Precise Connections
Code Reusability:

That's right. Generics allow you to write a single class, interface, or method that can operate with various data types. This helps you avoid repeating code for each specific data type.

Example: A printArray<T>(T[] array) function can print any array, whether it's of String, Integer, or a custom object type.

Loose Coupling:

Correct. Generics make your classes and methods less dependent on a concrete data type. This means different components in your program can work together more easily without needing to know the specific details of each other.

Example: The List<T> class doesn't need to know what type of data it holds, only how to manage a collection of objects.

Impact on SOLID:

You mentioned the Interface Segregation Principle, but Generics are also closely related to the Liskov Substitution Principle.

Liskov Substitution Principle: This principle states that a subtype should be able to replace its supertype without altering the correctness of the program. Generics support this by ensuring type safety.

Interface Segregation Principle: This principle encourages creating small, specific interfaces. Generics help you create more flexible interfaces that are tailored to specific functionalities.
